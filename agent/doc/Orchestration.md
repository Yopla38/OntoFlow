## Introduction

The agent orchestration system is a framework designed to automate and coordinate the development of software projects using agents powered by LLMs (Large Language Models). It enables efficient collaboration between specialized agents, each with a specific role in the development process.

### Key Features
- Configurable and flexible workflow  
- Task management with dependencies  
- Parallel processing  
- Automatic validation  
- Interactive HTML interface  

## Architecture

### Main Components

orchestrator/
├── agents/ # Agent definitions
├── components/ # Managers (files, tasks)
├── workflow/ # Orchestration logic
└── interface/ # User interface


### Data Flow
1. Project description → Architect  
2. Architect → Tasks  
3. Engineer → Task distribution  
4. Developers → Implementation  
5. Tester → Validation  
6. Reviewer → Revision  

## Configuration

### Project Configuration
```python
project_config = {
    "name": "project_name",
    "description": "Detailed project description",
    "workspace": "/path/to/workspace",
    "requirements": {
        "python_version": "3.10",
        "dependencies": ["package1", "package2"]
    }
}
```
Agent Configuration
```python
agent_config = {
    "name": "agent_name",
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",  # or another model
    "prompt": """
    Detailed instructions for the agent...
    """,
    "pydantic_model": {
        # Response validation structure
    }
}
```

Workflow Configuration

    "initial_state": "analysis",
    "states": {
        "analysis": {
            "type": "processing",
            "agent": "Architect",
            "transitions": {
                "success": "engineering",
                "error": "error"
            }
        },
        "engineering": {
            "type": "processing",
            "agent": "Engineer",
            "transitions": {
                "success": "development",
                "error": "error"
            }
        },
        "development": {
            "type": "parallel_workflow",
            "task_assignment": {
                "source": "engineering",
                "field_mapping": {
                    "tasks": "tasks",
                    "agent": "assigned_role"
                }
            },
            "transitions": {
                "success": "testing",
                "error": "error"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
State Types

    processing: Sequential processing by an agent

    parallel_workflow: Parallel task processing

Transitions

    success: Move to the next state

    error: Error handling

    needs_revision: Return for revision

Task Management
Task Structure

```python
task = {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Task title",
    "description": "Detailed description",
    "assigned_role": "agent_role",
    "priority": 1,
    "dependencies": [2, 3],  # IDs of tasks this one depends on
    "files": ["path/file1", "path/file2"],
    "acceptance_criteria": [
        "Criterion 1",
        "Criterion 2"
    ]
}
```
Task States

    pending: Waiting

    in_progress: In progress

    completed: Completed

    failed: Failed

    needs_revision: Requires revision

Usage Examples
Simple Initialization

```python
from orchestrator import WorkflowOrchestrator, FileManager, TaskManager

# Create managers
file_manager = FileManager("/path/project")
task_manager = TaskManager()

# Project configuration
project_description = """
Detailed project description...
"""

# Create orchestrator
orchestrator = WorkflowOrchestrator(
    workflow_config=workflow_config,
    agents=agents,
    project_description=project_description,
    task_manager=task_manager,
    file_manager=file_manager
)

# Execution
results = await orchestrator.execute()

Custom Workflow

custom_workflow = {
    "initial_state": "development",
    "states": {
        "development": {
            "type": "processing",
            "agent": "Backend_Developer",
            "transitions": {
                "success": "complete",
                "error": "error"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Best Practices
Agent Configuration

    Clear and specific prompts

    Data validation with Pydantic

    Proper error handling

Task Management

    Atomic and independent tasks

    Clearly defined dependencies

    Measurable acceptance criteria

Workflow

    Clearly defined states

    Logical transitions

    Validation at every step

Troubleshooting
Common Issues

    Configuration Error

# Configuration check
if not orchestrator.validate_config():
    print(orchestrator.get_config_errors())

Blocked Tasks

# Check dependencies
blocked_tasks = task_manager.get_blocked_tasks()
print(f"Blocked tasks: {blocked_tasks}")

Agent Errors

    # Detailed error logging
    logging.getLogger('orchestrator').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

Recommended Solutions

    Check configurations

    Validate dependencies

    Review logs

    Test agents individually
