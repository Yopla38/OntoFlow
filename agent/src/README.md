# Data Flow

1. The user submits a request  
2. The orchestrator decomposes it into tasks  
3. Agents process tasks via LLMs  
4. Results are validated and stored  
5. The cycle continues until completion  

---

# Potential Use Cases

- Automated development of software components  
- Automatic code review  
- Code documentation  
- AI-assisted refactoring  
- Automated testing  
- Code generation from specifications

# 1. Code Analysis

The project is a sophisticated autonomous agent system designed for software development. It is built around several key components:

- A multi-agent system with specialized roles  
- A modular architecture with clear separation of responsibilities  
- A flexible memory management system  
- A robust workflow orchestrator  
- Security mechanisms for code execution  

---

# 2. Functional Overview

The system enables:  
- Automation of complex development tasks  
- Collaboration between specialized agents  
- Source code management with validation  
- Continuous learning through a knowledge base  
- Secure execution of code in isolated environments  

---

# 3. Workflow Description

### 1. Initialization
- Creation of agents based on their roles  
- Configuration of providers (LLM, memory)  
- Preparation of the execution environment  

### 2. Processing
- Reception of tasks  
- Distribution to appropriate agents  
- Parallel execution when possible  
- Validation of results  
- Storage of acquired knowledge  

---

# 4. Potential Issues

- Concurrency management in file access  
- Strong dependency on external services (OpenAI, Anthropic)  
- Complexity of state management  
- Need for memory optimization for large projects  
- Lack of automated tests  

---

# 5. Usage Instructions

To use the system:

```python
# Agent configuration
config = {
    "agents": [...],
    "workflow": {...}
}

# Orchestrator creation
orchestrator = WorkflowOrchestrator(config, agents, project_description)

# Execution
results = await orchestrator.execute()

The system requires:

    Python 3.10+

    Appropriate API keys

    A configured virtual environment
